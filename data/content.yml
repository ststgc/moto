    title: Thank you for using Poin.
    detail: "<p>Oyster launched two years ago with a simple idea to build a better way to read on mobile. We’ve made incredible progress towards that goal—the vast majority of reading on Oyster happens on a mobile phone and we’ve dramatically improved mobile reading with product features like Lumin and leading editorial content on the Oyster Review. Through it all, our mission has remained the same: connect readers with books they’ll love.</p><p>As we continue on, we couldn’t be more excited about the future of ebooks and mobile reading. We believe more than ever that the phone will be the primary reading device globally over the next decade—enabling access to knowledge and stories for billions of people worldwide.</p> <p>Looking forward, we feel this is best seized by taking on new opportunities to fully realize our vision for ebooks. With that, we will be taking steps to sunset the existing Oyster service over the next several months. If you are an Oyster reader you will receive an email personally regarding your account in the next few weeks. We look forward to sharing more details soon, but rest assured, your account will continue to operate normally in the meantime. If you’d like to request a refund, please contact us at refunds@oysterbooks.com.</p><p>We’re excited for what’s next, but for now we hope you continue to live the life well read with all of us at Oyster.</p><p> Onwards, Eric, Andrew, Willem, and Team Oyster</p>"
